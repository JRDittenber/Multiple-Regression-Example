This is part 1 in a series on Multiple (linear) Regression using R and Matrix Methods. 
Part 1: Calculate the model coefficients using matrix methods, verify using R and interpret coefficients and test for significance. No categorical variables. Explanation of diagnotics and plots.
Part 2:  Calculate the model coefficients using matrix methods, verify using R and interpret coefficients and test for significance. Includes categorical variables. Explanation of diagnotics and plots.
Part 3: Calculate the standarized regression coefficients using matrix methods, verify using R and interpret coefficients and test for significance. Explanation of diagnotics and plots.
Part 4: Using Extra Sum of Squares and Exploring Multicollinearity 
Part 5:Influential observations, leverage and other diagnostics (including plots)

Each section will include a video tutorial, LaTeX code and Rmarkdown doc.
